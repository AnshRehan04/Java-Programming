Ques : Why we need Thread ? 
Ans : To optimal use of CPU/Memory

Important : Java is Single Threaded Application. 
It uses Single Thread. i.e Main

Use of Multithreading 
 ->If we uses multiple threads instead of one thread it makes faster Exceution.
     e.g : Suppose we have an array of 500 elements {1,2,3,4,5...500} we have to multiple each element by 2 suppose it takes 8secs to do this task but if we use 4 threads or more it makes this task complete in less than 8secs.


Thread in Java : 
Threads are the inbuild class in java.
 ->To Achieve Threads in Java just call its object.

Thread t1=new Thread();

There are numerous number of methods of Threads.
t1.sleep();
t1.start();
t1.stop();
