Wrapper Class: It is a class in java whose objects wraps or contains primitive data types .
We can create an object to a wrapper class.We can store primitive data types.

char  -> Character
byte  -> byte
long  ->Long 
double -> Double 

We can create an object of primitive data type using wrapper class.
Integer obj1=new Integer(12);
Integer obj2=Integer.valueof(12);
Integer obj3=12;  //autoboxing

Autoboxing : It means conversion of primitive types into object of their corresponding wrapper classes.
e.g int to Integer ,long to Long etc.

Unboxing : It is opposite of Autoboxing . It is conversion of the object of wrapper classes into primitive type.
e.g int to Integer , double to Double etc.

int obj4=obj; //Unboxing

Generics : Generics means paramterized types.Using Generics,it is possible to create classes that work
with different data types.

Suppose you want to create a class with a constructor . if you want to create multiple objects of same class with different datatypes
we can create using generics.

It only supports non-primitive datatypes.

Generics Methods : Similar to Generics class,we can also create a method that can be used with any type of data.Such class is known as Generics method.
public <T> void printdata(E data){
    sout(data);
}

Where T is the type of data type.(Non-Primitve)
